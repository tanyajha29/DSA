# DSA for Campus Placements

A minimal, professional DSA workspace aligned with campus placements.
LeetSync folders remain untouched; curated solutions live here.

## Structure
- Arrays
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- Two_Pointers
- Sliding_Window
- Hashing
- Recursion_Backtracking
- Trees
- Graph
- Patterns

## How to Use
- One file per problem
- Clean, readable solutions
- Focus on patterns and interviews

## Naming Convention
- File: `problem_name.cpp`
- Example: `two_sum.cpp`

## When to Add a Problem Here
- You can explain the approach clearly
- You know the pattern it belongs to
- You can state time/space complexity

## Note
- Existing `Recursion/` folder was preserved to avoid deleting anything.
- Prefer new content in `Recursion_Backtracking/`.
